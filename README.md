# JPACRUDProject

# Description
For this project, we were asked to create a database, and use it alongside a full-stack web application to manipulate the data in the database using CRUD commands. I've been building guitars from scratch, and having other adventures in woodworking since the age of 17, so I saw this project as an oppertunity to finally create a system that would keep track of my scrap wood storage. When the web application is opened, the user is presented with 3 options, as well as the entire contents of the database displayed. The user has the option to update a particular entry in the database, delete it altogether, and lastly, the option to add a new entry. Once the action is completed, the user can navigate back to the home page to see the database contents in their entirety.

# Lessons Learned

There were many lessons learned in this project. Doing everything for this project from start to finish revealed to myself many of my weaknesses as a programmer. I learned how important it is to at the very least have a mental roadmap as to how to accomplish the goal. I was going in blind at first, and this caused me to make many mistakes which I had to deal with later in order to create a final project. I learned a lot about troubleshooting Spring Boot error messages, and also just how valuable that skill can be as a developer. Lastly, I learned (again) that there is no reason to panic when beginning a project which will be using topics I'm not 100% comfortable with. The answers to any questions I may have in the process of completing the project, are out there. The importance of taking small bites of a task until the task is done was emphasized greatly.
